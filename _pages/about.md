Hello! I'm Andrea Moschetto, a passionate software engineer driven by technology. I graduated cum laude with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Catania in March 2024.

My eagerness to explore and embrace new opportunities has steered me towards diverse ventures. Being welcomed into the ranks of Herakel as a Software Engineer and Developer in January 2023, I've honed programming skills and adopted innovative approaches.

As I move forward, my goal is to expand expertise and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts. I'm excited to explore evolving technology landscapes, algorithms, design patterns, game development, and AI.
